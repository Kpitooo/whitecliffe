### What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?

Time managment method.

Timeboxing is different because it encourages you to focus on time instead of tasks.
Many people approach their work one task at a time, and concentrate on each until they complete it, however long this takes.

To use this time-management  tool, you allocate a certain number of hours or days, called a "timebox," to each activity. 
You then use this time – and only this time – to complete the task.
Timeboxing is a simple and effective way to manage your own, and your team members', daily workload.
for yourself, this ensures that you don't spend too long on a task that isn't worth the effort.
