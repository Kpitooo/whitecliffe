In this assessment, you're expected to create a flow diagram and some pseudo code.

Both the flow diagram and pseudo code should represent a program logic developed or researched throughout the course.

You may like to choose to diagram the software that you've presented in your final project.

Think about this in a broad sense of how you might communicate your thinking process as it's been developed into the language of software.

Flowcharts can be used as part of the planning phase of a software development life cycle. However, in this case, what we want you to do is to use it as a reflective tool to look back at what you have done and to look at the program logic that you have created or found to be useful for your learning. This could be seen as a professional working brief retrofit to the purposes of your learning.

Still little bit on the air, but im strong in creating and designing so I try to put together my ideas in a website
